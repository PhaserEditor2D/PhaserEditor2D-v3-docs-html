Supported object types
----------------------

The |SceneEditor|_ is in active development and only supports a very basic set of object types. Eventually, we should add more types and more properties. 

The way the prefabs_ work also allow to use a prefab_ as a black box. This black box can be added to the scene, but you can provide a custom implementation. This technique is covered in the section `Using a prefab as a black box <prefab-black-box.html>`_.

These are the supported object types:

* `Image <image-object.html>`_

* `Sprite <sprite-object.html>`_

* `Tile Sprite <tile-sprite-object.html>`_

* `Text <text-object.html>`_

* `Bitmap Text <bitmap-text-object.html>`_

* `Object List <object-list.html>`_
