Learn Phaser with Phaser Editor 2D
----------------------------------

|PhaserEditor|_ helps you to make a couple of tasks that could be very tedious to do yourself, manually. However, it requires you to known Phaser_ and JavaScript programming.

Some users ask us if it is better to learn Phaser_ first, and then go with the IDE, or if the IDE helps them to learn Phaser_.

In the previous version of the IDE, we included a lot of tools to learn Phaser_, but in this version, we are providing only the tools for create the games (soon, we should deliver a brand new product dedicated only to learn Phaser_).

However, we think the current IDE is a good resource to start learning Phaser_:

* It creates the projects for you and you can start writing Phaser_ code quickly.

* The projects are fully compatible with external tools, like |vscode|_.

* Because it helps you on making the scenes, you can create your first level very quickly and get motivated.

* The scenes are compiled to a clean and readable Phaser_ code, so you can learn from it too.

* Practically all the tools in the IDE are based on the Phaser_ standards, "everything" you learn about the IDE may help you to understand Phaser_.
