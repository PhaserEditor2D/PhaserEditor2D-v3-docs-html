Adding animations to the file
-----------------------------

To create a new animation, press the **Add Animation** button in the toolbar. It shows a dialog to enter the animation name:

.. image:: ../images/animations-add-animation-1.webp
  :alt: Create a new animation.

Because empty animations are not allowed, it opens a dialog to select the initial animation's frames. If you select a texture atlas or spritesheet, all the frames will be added to the animation:

.. image:: ../images/animations-add-animation-2.webp
  :alt: Select the animation frames.

.. image:: ../images/animations-add-animation-3.webp
  :alt: The new created animation.
