Licensing and pricing
---------------------

|PhaserEditor|_ is a commercial product. You can use it for free in small games. For projects with a bigger number of files, you should purchase a license key and unlock the IDE.

However, a huge part of the IDE is open-source (MIT license) and you can modify it or use it in your own project.
