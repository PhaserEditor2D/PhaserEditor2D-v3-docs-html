Adding an object to the scene
-----------------------------

.. toctree::

    blocks-view-integration
    add-object-context-menu
    add-object-automatic-container

There are multiple ways to create new objects in the scene. `Dropping an asset or built-in type from the Blocks view <blocks-view-integration.html>`_. Or pasting an object (including those from other scenes). 

Also, following a `set of rules <add-object-automatic-container.html>`_, the editor determines (or create) the parent for the new object.
