Inspector view
--------------

The |InspectorView|_ shows the properties of the objects selected in the active view or editor.

The properties are grouped into sections. The sections can be collapsed/expanded.

The label of the property supports tooltip. Usually, this tooltip is the correspondent |PhaserAPI|_ documentation of the property.

In addition to common properties, a section can display preview images or buttons to apply certain operations to the selected objects.
