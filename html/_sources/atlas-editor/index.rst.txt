Atlas Editor
------------

Using texture maps is practically a requirement in any professional game made with Phaser_. In all previous version of |PhaserEditor|_ we included the tools to create texture maps. However, a texture packer is not ready yet for this version of the IDE.

You can use third-party tools to create the texture maps:

* `Texture Packer <https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker>`_ is maybe the most popular tool in the Phaser_ community. It has an option to export to Phaser_.

* Download Phaser Editor v2 and use its `Texture Packer Editor <https://phasereditor2d.com/docs/v2/texture-packer-editor.html>`_. It is a huge download.

* `Atlas Packer <http://gammafp.com/tool/atlas-packer/>`_, a free and online tool made by `gammafp <https://twitter.com/gammafp/>`_.
